electrical and electronics sector where energy
flow and power are key.

helping the logo stand out and be memorable in

The Logo Design
Concentric Circles: The multiple circles radiating
outward 
symbolize 
electrical 
waves 
or 
signals,
conveying the idea of energy transmission, connectivity,
and reach. This represents how Focus Electrical serves
a wide area across Malaysia with electrical products
and services.
Diagonal Line: The sharp diagonal line cutting through
the circles adds a sense of movement, direction, and
progress, implying that the company is forward-looking
and dynamic. It also gives the logo a feeling of precision
and sharp focus.
Bold “FOCUS” Text: The strong, bold lettering of
“FOCUS” reinforces the brand’s identity as reliable and
confident. The way the letters overlap slightly with the
circles suggests integration of the brand with the
electrical energy concept.
