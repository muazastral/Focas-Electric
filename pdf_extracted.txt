Focus Electrical Malaysia
Behind Our Logo
The Colour (Red)
Energy & Power: Red is a powerful colour often
associated with energy, strength, and
dynamism, perfect for a company in the
electrical and electronics sector where energy
flow and power are key.
Passion & Commitment: Red signals passion
and dedication, reflecting Focus Electrical
Malaysia commitment to providing quality
products and excellent service.
Visibility & Attention: Red grabs attention easily,
helping the logo stand out and be memorable in
a competitive market. It suggests urgency and
responsiveness, traits valued by customers who
want quick solutions.
The Logo Design
Concentric Circles: The multiple circles radiating
outward symbolize electrical waves or signals,
conveying the idea of energy transmission, connectivity,
and reach. This represents how Focus Electrical serves
a wide area across Malaysia with electrical products
and services.
Diagonal Line: The sharp diagonal line cutting through
the circles adds a sense of movement, direction, and
progress, implying that the company is forward-looking
and dynamic. It also gives the logo a feeling of precision
and sharp focus.
Bold “FOCUS” Text: The strong, bold lettering of
“FOCUS” reinforces the brand’s identity as reliable and
confident. The way the letters overlap slightly with the
circles suggests integration of the brand with the
electrical energy concept.

our packaging for online product shipments.

sources.

cut down greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change
mitigation.
